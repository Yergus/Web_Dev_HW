The article was gave me an insight on what it's like to be a UX Architect
There is a lot of communication that's involved in these kinds of job which
was something that I didn't know before. The importance of communication is
highlighted in the article. It's important to ask a lot of questions
and identify what the problem is before starting anything. In fact, actually
making the website is one of the last things you do. Having a good team
to identify what you need is also a nice thing since they can get direct
feedback from potential users and the managers. Also, understanding who
will be using the website is important, since different people want different
things. In general, the whole process of wireframing is pretty in depth and detailed
but very crucial in designing a good product.
