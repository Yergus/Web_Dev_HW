I wanted to create a text generator in order to make a word of the day initially but I 
couldn't figure out how to make random comprehensible words. I did find the Math.random()
function to be particularly useful. I think I would need to make an array of actual words
if I want to make a random word of the day because utilizing just letters would be extremely 
hard to craft comprehensible words.
